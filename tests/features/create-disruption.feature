Feature: Create disruption

    Scenario: we cannot create a disruption without client
        I fill in header "X-Contributors" with "contrib1"
        I fill in header "X-Coverage" with "jdr"
        I fill navitia authorization in header

        When I post to "/disruptions"

        And the header "Content-Type" should be "application/json"
        And the field "error.message" should be "The parameter X-Customer-Id does not exist in the header"

        I fill in header "X-Customer-Id" with "5"
        I fill in header "X-Coverage" with "jdr"
        I fill navitia authorization in header
